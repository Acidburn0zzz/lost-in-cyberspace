This game is made for the js13kgame'17 competition.

The *Lost in Cyberspace* is a cooperative game designed for 2 players playing on separate devices. The only connection you need between each other is your voice. You can be in the same room or on the other part of the world as long as you can hear each other.

One player takes a role of a *HACKER* lost in the cyberspace maze of a corporate network. Their role is to move around cyberspace, read access codes to *NAVIGATOR*, find a target node and hack it.
Hacking wrong terminals will make the *HACKER* easier to locate and lose some time. When the time runs out, it's the end of a game!

The other player takes a role of a *NAVIGATOR* who uses terminal to decode access codes they got from *HACKER*. He/she reads the map of cyberspace network *HACKER* is trapped in and help them find the way to the target node.

Retro CRT like terminal styling based on https://codepen.io/somethingformed/pen/raWJXV demo.
